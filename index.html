  <p>I joined Howard Brown Health as a Government Grants Manager in December 2016, 
    where I oversee the agency’s robust Ryan White grant portfolio. 
    In particular, my expert data and quality management ensures the successful submission of the annual 
    Ryan White Service report, 
    as well as frequent reports on Howard Brown’s high number of Ryan White patients throughout the year. </p>
  <p>I have been a longtime public health advocate; 
    I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from the University of Michigan and 
    a Masters of Science in Social Work, with a concentration in Social Enterprise Administration, 
    from Columbia University. During my time at Columbia University, 
    I interned with SAE and Health Management Associates, 
    where I assisted in grant writing projects for nonprofits across the country. 
    Before joining Howard Brown, I was the Executive Assistant at the Civic Federation, 
    where I scheduled meetings and coordinated public health events throughout the year.</p>
